## About Me

I'm a second-year Master student in Industrial Engineering at University of Illinois [(ISE @ Illinois)](https://ise.illinois.edu/), with concentration in Advanced Analytics and Computational Science & Engineering. I worked with [Prof. Justin A. Sirignano](http://jasirign.github.io/) on Deep Learning with High-Frequency Finacial Data. I am currently working with [Prof. Bob Norris](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/wrnorris) on Autonomous Vehicles. My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Within AI, I am interested in problems related to probabilistic modeling, machine learning and recently, self-driving cars. I obtained my Bachelor Degree in [Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/), majoring in Harbor, Waterway and Coastal Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Tingguo Chen](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/chentg/zh_CN/index/786083/list/index.htm). I worked with [Prof. Meng Jiang](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/1998011035/zh_CN/index.htm) on my thesis topic being "The Structure Design of a Gravity Quay Wall of Ocean Fishery Group in Dalian".
